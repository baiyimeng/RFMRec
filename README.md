# Riemann Flow Matching Recommender (RFMRec)

This project implements Riemann Flow Matching Recommender (RFMRec), a sequential recommendation framework combining a Transformer encoder with a Flow Matching Head on a Riemannian sphere.

> Data and code are based on [ADRec](https://github.com/Nemo-1024/ADRec) and [flow_matching](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flow_matching).
